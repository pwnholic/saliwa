## Table Stakes (Must Have)

Features users expect. Missing these means the product feels incomplete or unusable for production.

### Core Connectivity

| Feature | Complexity | Why Essential |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **REST API Client** | Medium | Universal requirement for all exchanges. Every operation requires REST. Users cannot interact with exchanges without it. |
| **WebSocket Streams** | High | Real-time data is non-negotiable for trading. Polling REST APIs introduces unacceptable latency for market data. |
| **Authentication (HMAC/RSA/Ed25519)** | Medium | Required for any private API operations. All exchanges require signed requests for trading. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Medium | Exchanges ban clients that exceed limits. Essential for production reliability. |
| **Reconnection Handling** | High | WebSocket connections drop. Automatic reconnection with resubscription is required for any serious use. |

### Market Data

| Feature | Complexity | Why Essential |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Ticker Streams** | Low | Most basic market data. Expected by every trading application. |
| **Order Book Streams** | High | Essential for market making, arbitrage, and most trading strategies. |
| **Trade Streams** | Low | Historical and real-time trades are fundamental for analysis and strategy. |
| **Symbol/Market Info** | Low | Required for price/quantity precision, min notional, etc. |

### Order Management

| Feature | Complexity | Why Essential |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Place Order** | Medium | Core trading operation. Cannot trade without it. |
| **Cancel Order** | Medium | Essential for risk management and strategy execution. |
| **Query Order Status** | Low | Required for reconciliation and state management. |
| **Order Type Support** | Medium | LIMIT and MARKET are universally expected. Missing them makes the library unusable. |

### Account Data

| Feature | Complexity | Why Essential |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Balance Tracking** | Low | Required for position management and risk calculation. |
| **Position Tracking** | Medium | For derivatives/futures. Required for any leverage trading. |
| **User Data Stream** | Medium | Real-time order updates, balance changes via WebSocket. |

### Error Handling

| Feature | Complexity | Why Essential |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Structured Errors** | Low | Users need to distinguish between rate limits, auth errors, network issues, etc. |
| **Retry Logic** | Medium | Transient errors happen. Without retry, users lose orders. |

## Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that set the product apart. Not universally expected, but highly valuable.

### Architecture & Design

| Feature | Complexity | Value Proposition |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Actor-Based Architecture** | High | Erlang-style supervision provides fault isolation. One component crash doesn't bring down the system. Unique in Go ecosystem. |
| **Unified Cross-Exchange API** | High | Single interface for Binance and Bybit. Reduces integration effort for multi-exchange strategies. CCXT is the reference for this. |
| **CQRS Pattern for Orders** | Medium | Separate command (write) and query (read) paths. Enables high-throughput order state queries without blocking order placement. |
| **Event-Driven Design** | Medium | Loose coupling via events. Users subscribe to what they need. Clean extension points for custom logic. |

### Reliability & Resilience

| Feature | Complexity | Value Proposition |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Circuit Breaker Pattern** | Medium | Health monitoring per exchange. Automatic failover prevents cascading failures. Essential for production. |
| **Clock Synchronization** | Medium | Exchange APIs reject requests with stale timestamps. Automatic sync prevents timestamp errors. |
| **Nonce Management** | Low | Unique nonces for signed requests. Prevents replay attacks and request rejection. |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Medium | System continues with reduced functionality when components fail. |

### Advanced Features

| Feature | Complexity | Value Proposition |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Cross-Exchange Aggregation** | High | Merge order books from multiple exchanges. Enables arbitrage and best-price routing. Rare feature. |
| **Risk Management Hooks** | Medium | Pre-trade validation callbacks. Users inject custom risk checks before orders execute. |
| **Decimal Precision Handling** | Medium | Arbitrary precision for financial calculations. Prevents floating-point errors. Professional requirement. |
| **Backpressure Management** | Medium | Handle message bursts without overwhelming downstream consumers. Prevents memory exhaustion. |

### Developer Experience

| Feature | Complexity | Value Proposition |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Comprehensive Documentation** | Medium | API references, examples, migration guides. Reduces integration time significantly. |
| **Test Infrastructure** | Medium | Mock exchange, integration test framework. Enables reliable testing without real API keys. |
| **Metrics & Observability** | Medium | Connection health, message rates, error rates. Critical for production monitoring. |

## Anti-Features (What NOT to Build)

Features to explicitly NOT include. Common mistakes or scope creep to avoid.

### Out of Scope

| Anti-Feature | Why Excluded | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Trading GUI/Dashboard** | Library focus is API connectivity. GUI is a separate product. | Provide examples showing how to build UI on top. |
| **Strategy Framework** | Users have their own strategies. Frameworks constrain flexibility. | Provide event hooks for users to plug in their logic. |
| **Backtesting Engine** | Different domain with different requirements (historical data, simulation). | Focus on live trading. Users can use dedicated backtesting tools. |
| **Signal/Alert System** | Notifications are application-level concerns. | Provide event streams for users to build alerts. |
| **Portfolio Management** | Accounting, P&L tracking are separate concerns. | Provide balance/position data for users to build on. |

### Deferred Features

| Anti-Feature | Why Deferred | When to Consider |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Margin Trading** | Increases complexity significantly. Lower demand initially. | After spot trading is solid. |
| **Futures/Derivatives** | Additional complexity: funding rates, liquidations, leverage management. | Phase 2 after spot is production-ready. |
| **FIX Protocol Support** | Niche requirement. Only institutional users need it. | If enterprise customers request it. |
| **Additional Exchanges** | Binance + Bybit covers significant market share. | Add based on user demand. |

### Architecture Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Global State** | Makes testing impossible. Causes race conditions. | Actor-based state isolation. |
| **Blocking I/O in Hot Path** | Kills throughput under load. | Async message passing. |
| **Direct Goroutines for Errors** | No error handling, zombie processes. | Use errgroup, supervisors. |
| **Float64 for Money** | Precision loss causes incorrect calculations. | Use decimal arithmetic (apd). |
| **Shared State Between Actors** | Breaks actor isolation. Hard to reason about. | Message passing only. |

## Exchange-Specific Considerations

### Binance

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **API Version** | Spot API v3 |
| **Base URL** | `https://api.binance.com` |
| **WebSocket URL** | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws` |
| **Rate Limit Type** | Request weight system (1200/minute) |
| **Authentication** | HMAC SHA256, RSA, Ed25519 |
| **Order Types** | LIMIT, MARKET, STOP_LOSS, STOP_LOSS_LIMIT, TAKE_PROFIT, TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT, LIMIT_MAKER |
| **WebSocket Streams** | Single stream per connection, or combined streams |
| **Special Features** | OCO orders, iceberg orders, trailing stops |
| **Testnet** | Available for spot trading |

**Binance-Specific Implementation Notes:**
- Rate limits use weighted requests (different endpoints have different weights)
- WebSocket ping/pong every 20 seconds, pong within 60 seconds
- Order book updates use delta format requiring snapshot reconciliation
- Server time must be within 5 seconds for signed requests

### Bybit

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **API Version** | V5 Unified API |
| **Base URL** | `https://api.bybit.com` |
| **WebSocket URL** | `wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/public/spot` |
| **Rate Limit Type** | Per-second limits (varies by endpoint) |
| **Authentication** | HMAC SHA256 |
| **Order Types** | Limit, Market, PostOnly |
| **WebSocket Streams** | Category-based (spot, linear, inverse, option) |
| **Special Features** | Batch orders, TP/SL in single order |
| **Testnet** | Available |

**Bybit-Specific Implementation Notes:**
- V5 API unifies spot, futures, and options under single interface
- WebSocket requires authentication for private channels
- Different endpoints for different product categories
- More generous rate limits than Binance

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Binance | Bybit |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Rate Limit Model | Weighted (complex) | Per-second (simpler) |
| WebSocket Auth | Signature-based | JWT or API key |
| Order Book Format | Delta updates | Snapshot + delta |
| Market Data Format | Per-symbol streams | Category-based streams |
| Testnet Access | API key required | Public testnet |
